                Sunday Bazar is a weekly market commonly found in Pakistani cities, especially in Karachi, Lahore, and other major urban centers. Sunday Bazar is a weekly market that plays an important role in urban life, especially for low- and middle-income communities who rely on it for affordable goods and daily necessities. Set up early in the morning and dismantled by evening, the bazar transforms ordinary streets or open grounds into a busy commercial space filled with vendors selling vegetables, fruits, clothes, household items, footwear, and second-hand goods.
            </p>
            <p>
                The market operates as part of the informal economy, where sellers depend on daily earnings rather than fixed salaries, making Sunday Bazar a crucial source of livelihood for many families. The atmosphere of the bazar is lively and crowded, with constant movement as buyers walk through narrow pathways, stopping to bargain, compare prices, and interact with shopkeepers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The variety of goods available in one place makes it a practical and accessible option for people from different social backgrounds. Vendors arrange their products on carts, plastic sheets, or temporary stalls, creating a visually dense environment that appears informal but functions efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond commerce, Sunday Bazar also serves as a social space where neighbors meet, conversations take place, and relationships between sellers and regular customers develop over time. Despite these challenges, Sunday Bazar continues to thrive because it fulfills essential needs that formal systems often fail to meet.
